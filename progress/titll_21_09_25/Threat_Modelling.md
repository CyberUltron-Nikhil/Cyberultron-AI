# Your Threat Model Is a Living Document: The Importance of Documentation and Maintenance üìù

We've covered the full lifecycle of threat modeling: from identifying assets and threats to prioritizing risks and implementing mitigations.  
This week, we'll focus on the final, often-overlooked step that makes the entire process effective: **documentation and maintenance**.  

A threat model is not a one-time security audit; it's a **living document** that must evolve with your system.

## üìå Why Documentation Is Crucial

If a threat model isn't documented properly, its value is lost.  
Effective documentation ensures that the security insights you've gained are **clear, consistent, and easy to share** with your team.  

It also serves as the **single source of truth** for your system‚Äôs security posture.

### ‚úÖ Key Components to Document

1. **Architecture Diagram**  
   - A clear **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** showing how data moves between system components, with marked **trust boundaries**.  
   - This is the foundation of your analysis.

   Example DFD (simplified):

   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
       User -->|Request| WebApp
       WebApp -->|Query| Database
       WebApp -->|Auth| IdentityProvider
       Database -->|Data| WebApp
       IdentityProvider -->|Token| WebApp

## Threat Table

A table that lists identified threats, their enabling vulnerabilities, risk scores, and proposed mitigations.

| Threat ID | Threat Description   | Vulnerability       | Risk Score | Mitigation              |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| T-01      | SQL Injection        | Unsanitized inputs  | High       | Parameterized queries   |
| T-02      | Data Exposure        | Weak TLS config     | Medium     | Enforce TLS 1.3         |
| T-03      | Privilege Escalation | Misconfigured IAM   | High       | Least privilege policies |

## Mitigation Reports

Detailed reports on the security controls implemented.  
Document **accepted risks** and **deferred risks** with justification.

### Example Mitigation Report

| Risk ID | Threat Description   | Mitigation Status | Notes                                |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| R-01    | SQL Injection        | Mitigated        | Implemented parameterized queries    |
| R-02    | Data Exposure        | Mitigated        | Upgraded TLS to 1.3                  |
| R-03    | Legacy System Access | Deferred         | Will deprecate legacy system in Q4   |
| R-04    | Misconfigured IAM    | Accepted         | Low business impact, monitored risk  |

## üîÑ Threat Model Maintenance: A Continuous Process

A static threat model quickly becomes outdated.  
As your system **adds new features, integrates services, or evolves**, new threats and vulnerabilities emerge.  

Maintaining your threat model is **essential for long-term security**.

### üí° Best Practices for Ongoing Maintenance

- **Integrate into CI/CD**  
  Incorporate threat model reviews into your pipeline.  
  Example: a pull request adding a new external dependency triggers a **mini threat review**.

- **Periodic Reviews**  
  Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually).  
  Helps reassess risks and ensure mitigations remain effective.

- **Event-Driven Updates**  
  Update the threat model after significant architectural changes.  
  Respond to new vulnerabilities discovered in the wild that affect your system.

## üöÄ Shifting Left: Embedding Security in Culture

By treating threat modeling as a **continuous process**, you embed a **proactive security mindset** into your development culture.  

Instead of reacting to incidents, you are **designing resilience into the system**.  
This aligns with **DevSecOps principles**, ensuring security is not an afterthought but a **core development practice**.

---

## üìù Summary and Conclusion

- **Threat modeling** helps you think like an attacker and fix weaknesses before exploitation.  
- Documentation ensures **clarity, knowledge sharing, and accountability**.  
- Maintenance keeps your model **relevant and actionable**.  

üëâ By making threat modeling a **core part of your development lifecycle**, you build secure, reliable, and trustworthy applications that protect your business and your users.
