# üìÑ Understanding the Components of Threat Modeling
---

## üîê Introduction

Threat modeling is the structured process of identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities within a software system. The purpose is to discover what could go wrong before the software is actually deployed or exposed to real-world users and attackers.

By conducting threat modeling during early design or development phases, we can avoid serious issues later in the lifecycle and reduce the cost and complexity of patching vulnerabilities post-release.

Threat modeling is not limited to traditional web applications. It applies to APIs, cloud environments, microservices, IoT devices, and even AI systems. The primary goal is to understand the system, recognize its weak points, and proactively build defenses around those areas.

## üß© Key Components of Threat Modeling 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the System

Before identifying threats, it‚Äôs crucial to fully understand the system architecture. This includes:

- Drawing diagrams like Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), Component Diagrams, or UMLs.
- Listing all system components: user interfaces, servers, APIs, databases, third-party services, internal services, etc.
- Showing how data moves between components and where inputs/outputs occur.
- Identifying boundaries between trust zones ‚Äî for example, internet users vs internal services.

This step ensures that everyone (developers, security engineers, architects) has a clear and shared view of the system.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Assets

Assets are the valuable parts of the system that we want to protect. Examples include:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like names, emails, and phone numbers
- Authentication data such as passwords, tokens, and biometric credentials
- Business-critical logic or algorithms
- System configurations, logs, secrets, and keys

Understanding what needs protection helps narrow down where attackers are most likely to strike.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Threats (Use STRIDE)

With the system mapped and assets listed, we begin identifying threats , things that could go wrong. STRIDE is a popular framework explained below that helps structure this process.

Ask STRIDE-based questions for each component:

- Can this component be spoofed?
- Can the data be tampered with?
- Could there be repudiation issues (lack of logs)?
- Could this reveal sensitive information?
- Can someone crash this service (DoS)?
- Is privilege escalation possible?

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are the weaknesses in your design or implementation that attackers can exploit. These include:

- Missing authentication on APIs
- Unencrypted or misconfigured data stores
- Unvalidated input fields (leads to XSS, SQLi)
- Use of outdated or vulnerable libraries
- Lack of logging or monitoring

Once identified, you can map threats to the corresponding vulnerabilities.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Assess Risks (Use DREAD or Risk Matrices)

Not every threat is equally dangerous. To prioritize them, use risk scoring models like **DREAD**. You assign numeric values to:

- **Damage**
- **Reproducibility**
- **Exploitability**
- **Affected Users**
- **Discoverability**

Then:

- Calculate an average or total score
- Use this score to rank the threats

This helps your team focus on fixing the most severe threats first.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Plan Mitigations

Once threats are ranked, mitigation strategies are created for each. These include:

- Applying authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Using encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Adding logging and alerting
- Rate limiting or input throttling
- Isolating critical services from the public internet

Each mitigation should reduce the likelihood or impact of a threat.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Review and Repeat

Threat modeling is not a one-time activity. It must be integrated into your software development lifecycle. Every time you:

- Add new features  
- Refactor architecture  
- Connect to third-party APIs  

You should revisit the threat model and re-evaluate risks. Continuous threat modeling improves long-term resilience.

## üî† STRIDE Framework for Threat Identification

| **STRIDE**                 | **Description**                         | **Example**                                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **S - Spoofing**           | Attacker pretends to be a valid user     | Fake credentials used to log in             |
| **T - Tampering**          | Altering API request data                | Changing parameters in transit              |
| **R - Repudiation**        | User denies performing an action         | Deleting logs to erase activity             |
| **I - Information Disclosure** | Leaking sensitive data                 | API exposes PII like phone numbers          |
| **D - Denial of Service**  | Making system unavailable                | Overloading endpoint with junk requests     |
| **E - Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorized access           | Normal user accesses admin functions        |

---

## üìä DREAD Risk Scoring Framework

| **DREAD**              | **Description**                                 | **Sample Questions**                         |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **D - Damage Potential** | How severe would the impact be?               | Could it cause data loss or system failure?   |
| **R - Reproducibility**  | Can the attack be performed again easily?     | How often will it succeed?                    |
| **E - Exploitability**   | Can it be done with little effort or tools?   | Is it possible without privileged access?     |
| **A - Affected Users**   | How many users would be affected?             | Will this impact all users or just a few?     |
| **D - Discoverability**  | How obvious is the vulnerability?             | Can it be found using common scanning tools?  |

**Scoring**: Each is scored 1‚Äì10. Use the total or average to assign risk levels like High, Medium, or Low.

## üõ†Ô∏è Sample Implementation Flow

Let‚Äôs assume we are threat modeling a banking web application with a login feature:

- **Component**: Login API  
- **Asset**: Username, password, session token  
- **STRIDE Threat**: Spoofing (Attacker tries to bypass login)  
- **Vulnerability**: No brute-force protection or MFA  

**DREAD Score**:

- Damage = 9  
- Reproducibility = 8  
- Exploitability = 7  
- Affected Users = 8  
- Discoverability = 6  

‚Üí **Average: 7.6 ‚Üí High Risk**

**Mitigation Plan**:
- Add rate limiting and CAPTCHA
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Log and monitor failed attempts

## üßÆ DREAD Risk Scoring

To calculate the DREAD score, each threat is evaluated across five categories:

| **DREAD Category**   | **What It Measures**                                          |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Damage Potential     | How severe the impact would be if the threat were exploited   |
| Reproducibility      | How easily the attack can be repeated                         |
| Exploitability       | How simple it is to carry out the attack                      |
| Affected Users       | How many users or systems could be affected                   |
| Discoverability      | How easy it is for an attacker to discover the vulnerability  |

Each category is scored on a scale of **1 to 10**, where **1** means very low risk and **10** means very high risk.  
Once all five scores are assigned, they are added together and averaged. This gives a final DREAD score between 1 and 10.

### üî¢ Formula:

DREAD Score = (Damage + Reproducibility + Exploitability + Affected Users + Discoverability) √∑ 5



The resulting score helps the team decide which threats to address first:

- A score between **8 and 10** is considered **High Risk** (should be fixed immediately)
- A score between **5 and 7** is **Medium Risk** (should be tracked and addressed soon)
- A score below **5** is **Low Risk** (can be reviewed periodically)

---

### üìå Example:

Suppose there‚Äôs a threat where an attacker can **brute-force a login page**:

- Damage = 9 (They can hijack accounts)  
- Reproducibility = 8 (It can be automated)  
- Exploitability = 7 (Easy for an attacker to try)  
- Affected Users = 8 (Affects any user who logs in)  
- Discoverability = 6 (Login form is publicly visible)  

**DREAD Score** = (9 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 6) / 5 = 38 √∑ 5 = **7.6**

This would be treated as a **high-risk threat** and prioritized for mitigation.
