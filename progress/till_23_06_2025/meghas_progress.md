## 1.3 Common Gaps

The following gaps in existing tools present opportunities for AIComply to differentiate itself:

### AI Governance:
- Only Vanta supports ISO 42001, but its implementation is shallow, lacking automated bias audits or model transparency controls.
- No tools support NIST AI RMF, critical for ethical AI compliance.

### Regional Regulations:
- No support for India’s RBI (data localization) or SEBI (audit reporting), or EU’s NIS (cybersecurity) or DORA (ICT risk management).

### Manual Effort:
- Scrut, Secureframe, Vanta, and Drata require manual tasks for custom controls, evidence mapping, or niche frameworks.

### Regulatory Tracking:
- No tools offer real-time monitoring of new regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, effective February 2025).

### Affordability for Startups:
- High costs (e.g., Drata $12,500+, Vanta $5,000+/year) exclude solo AI founders and early-stage startups.
