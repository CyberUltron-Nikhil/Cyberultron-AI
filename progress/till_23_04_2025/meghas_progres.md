## Megha's Progress 

Completed Tasks:

Successfully preprocessed and cleaned the CIC-IDS dataset.

Formatted input features into natural language format for model readiness.

Tokenized data using Hugging Face tokenizer.

Trained a BERT-based binary classification model to identify malicious HTTP requests.

Achieved low training and validation losses:

Final Training Loss: 0.0030

Final Validation Loss: 0.000026

Saved the trained model and tokenizer locally for future inference and integration.

Currently Working On: 

Starting to plan how to integrate the trained model into the AI agent flow.

Preparing to generate predictions and test classification on unseen HTTP traffic.



Pending /Roadblocks:

Preparing the inference pipeline.

Need clarity on how the output from the agent will generate dynamic rule suggestions for WAF.
