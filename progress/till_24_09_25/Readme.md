## About

**RiskPilot** is a full-stack, AI-powered platform for automated threat modeling and risk analysis. It enables teams to upload system diagrams, describe architecture, and instantly receive a comprehensive security assessment. RiskPilot maps threats, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues, and provides actionable remediation guidance, making security management efficient and proactive.

---

## Core Mission

Our mission is to **bridge the gap between identifying security threats and remediating them**, automating the process of risk analysis, compliance checks, and threat modeling. RiskPilot empowers developers and security professionals to understand and address security risks earlier and more effectively in the software lifecycle.

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Automated Threat Modeling:** Upload DFDs, describe your system, and get a full threat model (STRIDE, DREAD scoring, OWASP Top 10 mapping).
- **Compliance Tracking:** Maps threats to standards like ISO 27001, PCI DSS, NIST, SOC 2, and GDPR.
- **Risk Heatmaps & Dashboards:** Visualize threats, risk scores, and vulnerabilities.
- **Remediation Guidance:** AI-generated fixes and compliance recommendations.
- **LLM Security Scanning:** Analyze risks in large language model integrations.
- **Modern Web UI:** Interactive, responsive dashboard for security management.

---

## Target Users

- **Security Engineers:** Streamline threat analysis and compliance.
- **DevOps & Developers:** Integrate risk analysis into CI/CD and system design.
- **Compliance Officers:** Automated mapping to compliance frameworks.
- **Product Teams:** Assess and monitor risk throughout system evolution.

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Secure a New Application

1. **Upload DFD:** POST `/create/normal_system/pre_upload` with your system's Data Flow Diagram.
2. **Describe System:** Submit system details (architecture, dependencies, auth) via `/create/normal_system`.
3. **Analyze Risks:** View dashboard for risk scores, STRIDE/DREAD analysis, OWASP mapping, and compliance.
4. **Remediate:** Follow AI-generated fixes and compliance advice.
5. **Track:** Update threat statuses and monitor risk over time.

### Workflow 2: LLM Security Scan

1. **Submit LLM Model/Provider:** POST `/create/llm_scan` with provider and probes.
2. **Monitor Scan Status:** Poll `/fetch/llm_scan/{id}` for job status.
3. **Review Results:** Access vulnerabilities, risk scores, and suggested remediations.

---

## Use Cases

- **Architecture Risk Reviews:** Instantly model threats for new or evolving systems.
- **Compliance Readiness:** Map your system's risks to ISO, PCI, NIST, SOC2, GDPR, etc.
- **DevSecOps Integration:** Integrate threat modeling into CI/CD pipelines.
- **AI/LLM Security:** Assess risks unique to LLM and AI integrations.
- **Security Dashboards:** Give leadership and teams clear, up-to-date risk views.
