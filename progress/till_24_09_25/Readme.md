## Feature Deep Dives

### 1. Threat Modeling of Normal Systems

#### What It Does

- Accepts Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and detailed system architecture inputs (technology stack, authentication, sensitive data, etc.).
- Runs automated threat modeling using STRIDE, DREAD, and OWASP Top 10 methodologies.
- Identifies and scores threats, maps them to the affected components, and highlights both resolved and unresolved vulnerabilities.
- Visualizes attack surfaces, produces risk heatmaps, and aligns findings with compliance frameworks.

#### End-User Value

- **Security Engineers:**  
  - Save time by automating comprehensive threat models for each release and infrastructure change.
  - Focus reviews on the highest-risk threats thanks to risk scoring and prioritization.
  - Maintain consistent documentation for audit and compliance processes.

- **Developers & DevOps:**  
  - Integrate threat modeling into CI/CD pipelines and PR reviews.
  - Detect issues before code reaches production or cloud environments.
  - Receive actionable, context-specific remediation suggestions.

- **Cloud & Solution Architects:**  
  - Experiment with architectural changes and instantly see security implications.
  - Ensure new designs meet both security and compliance requirements.
  - Gain visual feedback (attack trees, heatmaps) for technical and non-technical audiences.

#### Typical User Workflow

1. **Upload DFD** and enter system details via dashboard or API.
2. **Automatic threat model generation:** STRIDE/DREAD/OWASP analysis, risk scoring.
3. **Review results:** Threat cards, risk scores, compliance mapping, and detailed vulnerability list.
4. **Take action:** Assign, track, and resolve issues; download compliance-ready reports.

#### Example API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create/normal_system/pre_upload \
  -F "image_file=@/path/to/your_dfd.png"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create/normal_system \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... system details ... }'
curl http://localhost:8000/fetch/normal_system/2
```

### 2. LLM Vulnerability Testing

#### What It Does

- Enables security analysis of LLM (Large Language Model) and GenAI integrations.
- Performs automated probing for LLM-specific risks: prompt injection, output manipulation, data leakage, supply chain vulnerabilities, and model abuse.
- Assigns risk scores to each finding and generates actionable remediation advice.
- Visualizes LLM attack vectors and context-specific compliance risks (e.g., data privacy, misuse).

#### End-User Value

- **AI/ML & Product Teams:**  
  - Test LLMs for prompt injection, output hijacks, data exposure, and more before and after deployment.
  - Validate that GenAI-powered features meet security/privacy standards.
  - Continuously monitor for new, emerging threats in the LLM threat landscape.

- **Security Engineers:**  
  - Integrate LLM scanning into broader threat modeling and security dashboards.
  - Automate GenAI security validation for every release.
  - Correlate LLM risks with other system and codebase vulnerabilities.

- **Compliance & Audit:**  
  - Demonstrate ongoing due diligence for AI-related compliance and governance.
  - Export LLM vulnerability and remediation reports for stakeholders.

#### Typical User Workflow

1. **Submit LLM provider/model and probes** for risk scanning.
2. **Automated vulnerability testing** is performed (e.g., prompt injection, prompt leaks).
3. **Review dashboard:** Severity-ranked vulnerabilities, attack trees, and remediation guidance.
4. **Mitigate:** Apply suggested fixes and re-test as needed.

#### Example API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create/llm_scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "provider": "OpenAI", "model": "gpt-4", "probes": ["ansiescape"] }'
curl http://localhost:8000/fetch/llm_scan/3
```

### 3. MCP Server Vulnerability Scanning

#### What It Does

- Integrates with MCP (Managed Code Pipeline) servers to automatically scan source code repositories for vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, misconfigurations, and compliance violations.
- Supports multi-repo, multi-language environments, providing centralized dashboards and unified reporting.
- Maps findings directly to compliance frameworks and allows for real-time tracking of remediation progress.

#### End-User Value

- **Developers & DevOps:**  
  - Get immediate, actionable feedback on code risks, secrets, and compliance issues before merge or deployment.
  - Automate codebase scanning as part of CI/CD to catch issues early.
  - Reduce manual review effort and improve code quality.

- **Security Engineers:**  
  - Orchestrate organization-wide code scanning across all MCP-managed repositories.
  - Focus on critical findings with risk-based prioritization.
  - Maintain an auditable record of codebase security posture and remediation history.

- **Compliance & Audit:**  
  - Monitor codebase compliance in real time, across all projects and teams.
  - Generate audit-ready reports and track regulatory adherence.
  - Ensure all code meets both security and compliance standards.

#### Typical User Workflow

1. **Trigger MCP scan** for one or more repositories and branches via dashboard or API.
2. **Automated scanning:** MCP analyzes code for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
3. **Review findings:** Vulnerability list by repo/branch, secret exposures, misconfigurations, compliance status.
4. **Remediate:** Assign, track, and resolve issues; export compliance/audit reports.

#### Example API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create/mcp_scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "repo_url": "https://github.com/org/repo", "branch": "main" }'
curl http://localhost:8000/fetch/mcp_scan/42
```
