## About

**RiskPilot** is an automated, AI-powered threat modeling and security risk analysis platform. It enables organizations and development teams to quickly identify, visualize, and manage security threats in their applications and cloud architectures. By uploading system diagrams and describing technical details, users get instant, actionable threat models, risk scores, vulnerability mappings (OWASP Top 10), compliance status, and AI-powered remediation advice. RiskPilot provides a seamless dashboard interface and REST API for end-to-end security management.

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Threat Model a New Application

**Step 1:** Upload your Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using `POST /create/normal_system/pre_upload`.  
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create/normal_system/pre_upload \
  -F "image_file=@/path/to/your_dfd.png"
```
**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Image saved to database",
  "id": 1
}
```

**Step 2:** Submit system details (architecture, dependencies, auth, etc.) via `POST /create/normal_system`.  
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create/normal_system \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "row_id": "1",
    "system_name": "E-Commerce API",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/org/repo",
    "access_token": "ghp_xxx",
    "dependencies": "Node.js, PostgreSQL",
    "arch_patt": "Microservices",
    "authentication": "JWT, OAuth2",
    "internet_facing": "yes",
    "sensitive_data": "Customer PII, Payment Info",
    "app_description": "Multi-service e-commerce backend.",
    "dep_type": "Cloud",
    "dep_plat": "AWS",
    "containerization": "Docker",
    "ci_cd": "GitHub Actions",
    "secret_mgmt": "AWS Secrets Manager"
  }'
```
**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Normal System Scan Job created successfully",
  "id": 2
}
```

**Step 3:** Review results in the dashboard‚Äîrisk scores, threat table, compliance mapping, OWASP tracker, visual heatmaps, attack trees (PASTA/MAESTRO), and status metrics.  
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/fetch/normal_system/2
```
**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "data": {
    "card_data": {
      "total_stride_threats": 15,
      "total_unresolved_threats": 5,
      "total_resolved_threats": 10,
      "risk_score": 8.2
    },
    "owasp_tracker": {
      "total_found": 2,
      "table_data": [
        {
