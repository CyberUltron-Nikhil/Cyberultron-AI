# Case Study 1: Securing Enterprise Payment Infrastructure with Automated Threat Modeling

## Client Overview
- **Company:** GlobalPay Solutions  
- **Industry:** Financial Technology (FinTech)  
- **Size:** Series B Startup, 150 employees  
- **Annual Transaction Volume:** $2.1 Billion  
- **Geographic Presence:** North America, Europe, APAC  

---

## Executive Summary
GlobalPay Solutions, a rapidly growing payment processing platform, faced critical security and compliance challenges during aggressive market expansion. Manual threat modeling processes created bottlenecks, delayed feature releases, and left compliance gaps ahead of a crucial SOC 2 Type II audit.  

By implementing **Threat Shield's automated threat modeling platform**, GlobalPay transformed their security architecture process, achieving:
- Zero critical vulnerabilities  
- 85% faster security reviews  
- Successful SOC 2 Type II audit certification  

---

## About Threat Shield
Threat Shield, part of the **Zero Shield platform**, provides advanced threat modeling and security intelligence for modern applications. The platform unifies:  
- Automated STRIDE analysis  
- LLM security testing  
- Vulnerability scanning  
- Real-time compliance mapping

## The Challenge

### Business Context
After securing $45M in Series B funding, GlobalPay committed to expanding into European and Asian markets within 12 months. This expansion required:  
- SOC 2 Type II certification  
- PCI DSS compliance  
- Weekly feature releases while maintaining security  
- Demonstrable security maturity for enterprise clients  

### Key Pain Points
1. **Security Review Bottleneck**  
   - Team of 3 overwhelmed with manual reviews  
   - 18‚Äì21 day average cycle time  
   - 14 features stuck in queue  
   - Development velocity severely impacted  

2. **Compliance Uncertainty**  
   - No systematic threat identification methodology  
   - Documentation scattered in spreadsheets/docs  
   - Failed SOC 2 pre-assessment  

3. **Unknown Risk Exposure**  
   - Critical vulnerabilities found in production  
   - No quantitative risk scoring  
   - Inability to visualize attack paths  

4. **Developer Friction**  
   - Vague security feedback  
   - Multiple revision cycles required  
   - Engineers viewed security as obstacle

*(Diagram placeholder here)*  

**Figure 2:** Payment Processing Data Flow  
*(Diagram placeholder here ‚Äì red highlights = vulnerabilities)*  

**First Results:**  
- Comprehensive threat model in 48 hours  
- 31 distinct STRIDE threats identified  
- Threat Score: 7.2 (High Risk)  
- 9 high-severity threats flagged  

---

### Phase 2: Discovery & Remediation

#### Critical Findings
- **Finding 1: Authentication Bypass**  
  - STRIDE: Spoofing, Elevation of Privilege  
  - DREAD: 8.5/10  
  - Compliance Impact: Failed SOC 2 + PCI DSS controls  
  - Guidance: OAuth 2.0 + JWT pattern w/ sample code  

**Figure 3:** Authentication & Secret Management Data Flow  
*(Diagram placeholder ‚Äì red = plain-text secrets)*  

- **Finding 2: Inadequate Encryption at Rest**  
  - STRIDE: Information Disclosure  
  - DREAD: 7.8/10  
  - PCI DSS violation (Requirement 3.4)  
  - Guidance: Database-level encryption with KMS  

- **Finding 3: Lateral Movement Path**  
  - STRIDE: Tampering, Elevation of Privilege  
  - DREAD: 6.9/10  
  - Compliance Impact: Failed segmentation controls  
  - Guidance: Zero-trust policies + PASTA attack tree  

#### Visualization Benefits
- DREAD Heatmap for risk prioritization  
- PASTA Attack Trees showing attack chains  
- OWASP Top 10 mapping for industry standards  
- Compliance dashboard = exact control failures  

---

### Phase 3: Integration & Continuous Security
- Embedded **Threat Shield as mandatory design gate**  
- Security team shifted from modeling ‚Üí validating  
- Developers got instant feedback on architecture  
- Continuous monthly reviews + compliance exports
