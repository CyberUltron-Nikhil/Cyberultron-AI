# STRIDE: A Powerful Framework for Categorizing Security Threats üõ°Ô∏è

In our last post, we discussed the importance of identifying threat actors and the threats they pose. This week, we'll get more specific by introducing a powerful and widely used framework for categorizing threats: **STRIDE**. Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE is a mnemonic that helps you think systematically about different types of attacks, ensuring you don't overlook a critical vulnerability.

## What is STRIDE?

STRIDE is an acronym that stands for six distinct categories of security threats.  
When you're threat modeling, you can apply each of these categories to the various components of your system (like data flows, processes, and data stores) to identify what could go wrong.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each:

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Example** |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **S ‚Äì Spoofing Identity** | Attacker impersonates someone/something else to gain access. | Stealing a session cookie to bypass authentication. |
| **T ‚Äì Tampering with Data** | Unauthorized modification of data. | Changing product prices in a URL to pay less. |
| **R ‚Äì Repudiation** | Denying an action without sufficient proof. | Fraudulent transaction without proper logging. |
| **I ‚Äì Information Disclosure** | Unauthorized access to sensitive information. | Error messages exposing database connection strings. |
| **D ‚Äì Denial of Service (DoS)** | Overwhelming a system to make it unavailable. | Flooding a server with requests until it crashes. |
| **E ‚Äì Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining higher access than intended. | Exploiting a bug to gain admin rights. |

## Why is STRIDE Effective?

The power of STRIDE lies in its **simplicity** and **coverage**. By systematically applying each category, you can:

- ‚úÖ **Systematically Assess Your System** ‚Äì Provides a structured approach instead of vague "hacking" concerns.  
- ‚úÖ **Prevent Overlooking Threats** ‚Äì Acts as a checklist so no category is missed.  
- ‚úÖ **Improve Communication** ‚Äì Gives developers and security teams a shared vocabulary.

## What‚Äôs Next?

In our next blog post, we‚Äôll build on this foundation by exploring how **vulnerabilities** and **attack vectors** are the keys that allow STRIDE threats to become reality. We'll show you how to find the weaknesses that make your system susceptible to attack.
