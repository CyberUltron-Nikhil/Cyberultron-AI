# From Weakness to Exploitation: The Role of Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors 💥

In our last post, we used the **STRIDE model** to systematically identify potential threats to a system. This week, we'll connect those threats to the specific **weaknesses that enable them** and the **paths attackers take to exploit them**. It's time to talk about **vulnerabilities and attack vectors**.

## 🧱 Vulnerabilities: The Weaknesses in Your System

A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a system's design, implementation, or configuration. It's the **"where"** a security problem exists. A threat is just a potential problem—until it finds a vulnerability to exploit.

> 💡 Think of it this way:  
> A threat is the desire to break a window to enter a house.  
> The vulnerability is a window that was left unlocked.  
> Without the unlocked window, the threat exists but **can't be executed** in that specific way.

### 🔍 Examples of Common Vulnerabilities:
- Unvalidated user input in a web form
- Weak encryption for data in transit
- Misconfigured CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allowing unauthorized access
- Missing authentication checks on an API endpoint

## 🛣️ Attack Vectors: The Path to Exploitation

An **attack vector** is the **path or method** an attacker uses to exploit a vulnerability.  
If a vulnerability is the unlocked window, the attack vector is the **specific act** of reaching the window, opening it, and climbing inside.

Understanding attack vectors helps you **close off the routes** an attacker might use.

### 🎯 Examples of Common Attack Vectors:
- Phishing to steal credentials
- SQL Injection via a form field
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in a comment section
- API key leakage in public code repositories

## 🔗 The Critical Connection: Threat, Vulnerability, and Attack Vector

To truly understand **risk**, you need to link all three concepts.  
They form a **chain** that leads to a security incident:

- **Threat**: What the attacker wants to do (e.g., steal user data)
- **Vulnerability**: The weakness that makes it possible (e.g., lack of input validation)
- **Attack Vector**: The method used to exploit the weakness (e.g., a SQL Injection in a login form)

> ✅ Without all three, the attack can't succeed.

Your job in **threat modeling** is to **break this chain**, usually by:
- **Addressing the vulnerability** (e.g., fixing code or config), or
- **Blocking the attack vector** with a security control (e.g., WAF, input validation, access control)

## 👀 Coming Up Next...

In our next blog post, we'll learn how to **prioritize** all the threats and vulnerabilities we've identified. We’ll introduce a **risk scoring model** called **DREAD** to help you decide which issues to fix first based on their **potential impact and likelihood**.

Stay tuned! 🔐
