# üõ°Ô∏è Detecting Bot Crawlers with Generative AI: A ZAPISEC Case Study

In today‚Äôs web-scale applications, distinguishing legitimate traffic from stealthy bots like **GoogleBot**, **BaiduBot**, **YahooBot**, or malicious crawlers is critical. These bots can silently flood your API, skew analytics, and even launch **Slowloris-style DDoS attacks** ‚Äî all while bypassing traditional security rules.

ZAPISEC, a GenAI-powered API firewall, solves this with **real-time anomaly detection** fueled by **Generative AI, Isolation Forests, and LSTM Autoencoders**‚Äî even when data flows in **gigabytes to petabytes per day**.

## üß® Problem: Stealth Bot Crawlers & Layer 7 DDoS (e.g., Slowloris)

Bots often:

- Spoof headers & IPs (fake GoogleBot)
- Send slow, partial HTTP headers to hold sockets open (Slowloris)
- Exploit server thread exhaustion with minimal bandwidth

This makes them *invisible to traditional WAFs* that rely on regex rules or IP reputation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ZAPISEC‚Äôs Generative AI‚ÄìBased Defense Strategy

### ‚úÖ 1. **Real-Time Bot Fingerprinting**
ZAPISEC captures unique signals like:

- TCP/IP patterns (TTL, window size)
- TLS metadata (JA3 hashes)
- Browser JS behavior (headless checks)
- HTTP header anomalies (delayed or incomplete headers)

These are analyzed in <10ms at the edge.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Generative AI Anomaly Detection Engine**

Using **Isolation Forest + LSTM Autoencoders**, ZAPISEC models:

- Normal request timings, header sequences, user-agent entropy
- Anomalies like prolonged socket life or slow POST/GET patterns
- Synthetic bot samples created via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Multilayer Throttling & Response Logic**

- **Good bots** (verified GoogleBot) are allowed with trust scores.
- **Malicious bots** are:
  - Dropped
  - Served a synthetic 200 OK with no backend hit
  - Given CAPTCHA or JS challenges
- Adaptive thresholds change in real-time based on LLM insights.

## üß™ Feature Engineering Used in GenAI Model

| Feature Name            | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `header_completion_time` | Delay from SYN to first full header |
| `open_socket_duration`  | Time connection remains open without completion |
| `header_entropy`        | Randomness in header order/values |
| `request_body_delay`    | Delay between headers and body |
| `tcp_retransmission_count` | Signs of stalled connections |

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Mitigation Flow

A ZAPISEC customer experienced slow API performance on `/checkout`. Here‚Äôs what happened:

1. GenAI detected **header trickling** from multiple regions.
2. Slowloris anomaly score > threshold.
3. ZAPISEC:
   - Dropped slow headers
   - Sent synthetic response to attacker
   - Activated Cloudflare rules via webhook
4. System retrained on attack pattern automatically.
