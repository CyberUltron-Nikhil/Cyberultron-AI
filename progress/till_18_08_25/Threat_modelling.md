# The ABCs of Threat Modeling: Assets, Trust Boundaries & Attack Surfaces 🔐

In threat modeling, three foundational concepts form the starting point for understanding *what* you need to protect and *where* you need to focus your defenses: **Assets**, **Trust Boundaries**, and **Attack Surfaces**.  
Think of these as the **“ABC”** of building a secure system.

## A — Assets 💎

**Definition:**  
Assets are *anything of value* that your system processes, stores, or transmits — essentially, the things an attacker would want to compromise.

**Examples:**
- **User Data:** Names, addresses, financial records, health information.
- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Proprietary algorithms, designs, or source code.
- **System Availability:** Critical uptime for services like payment gateways or hospital systems.
- **Credentials:** API keys, tokens, and passwords.
- **Infrastructure Components:** Databases, servers, IoT devices.

> **Pro Tip:** If you can’t clearly define your assets, you can’t protect them effectively.

## B — Trust Boundaries 🚧

**Definition:**  
A **trust boundary** is the point where the *level of trust* between two system components changes.

**Analogy:**  
Imagine your system as a house and the trust boundary as a **fence around your yard**.  
Inside the fence, you control who comes in. Outside, you have no control. Anyone crossing the fence line should be **checked, verified, and possibly restricted**.

**Why It Matters:**  
- Data coming from *outside* your trust boundary can be **malicious or corrupted**.
- Without validation at trust boundaries, attackers can inject harmful commands, bypass authentication, or exploit vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**
- Web browser → Web server
- Mobile app → Backend API
- Internal microservice → External payment gateway

## C — Attack Surfaces 🎯

**Definition:**  
An **attack surface** is any **point of interaction** between your system and the outside world that can be used to launch an attack.

**Examples:**
- **Login Forms:** Can be targeted for brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.
- **APIs:** Vulnerable to injection attacks, parameter tampering, and data leakage.
- **File Upload Portals:** Could be abused to upload malware or exploit parsing vulnerabilities.
- **Network Ports:** Open ports can expose services to unauthorized access.

## How They Interconnect 🔄

These three elements are deeply related:

1. **Assets** are *what you protect*.  
2. **Trust Boundaries** define *where* the risk increases because untrusted data or actors are involved.  
3. **Attack Surfaces** are *how* an attacker might reach those assets, especially across trust boundaries.

**Example Scenario:**  
- **Asset:** Customer credit card data stored in a database.  
- **Trust Boundary:** API endpoint receiving payment requests from an e-commerce website.  
- **Attack Surface:** Public payment form exposed to the internet.

In this case, securing the **attack surface** (form input & API) and enforcing strict **trust boundary validations** (data sanitization, authentication, encryption) protects the **asset** (credit card data).

## Final Thoughts

Mastering the **ABCs** of threat modeling ensures you have a clear map of:
- What matters most (**Assets**)
- Where trust changes (**Trust Boundaries**)
- How an attacker might get in (**Attack Surfaces**)

In next post, we’ll explore how to use the **STRIDE** framework to systematically identify potential threats and map them to these foundational elements.
